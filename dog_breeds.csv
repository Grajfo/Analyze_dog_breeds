Biewer Terrier,"The Biewer Terrier is a rare purebred dog created through the occurrence of a recessive piebald gene in two Yorkshire Terriers. These dogs are friendly, playful, and energetic, which are some of their best qualities. The Biewer Terrier, pronounced like “beaver,” are also known by the names Biewer à la Pom Pon, Biewer Yorkie, or Biewer Yorkshire. You may be able to find Biewer Terrier dogs at shelter and rescues, so remember to adopt! It’s always better than shopping! Since these energetic and lovable pups are small in stature, they are great for those who live in apartments or homes with or without backyards. They’re suited for a wide range of households from single and senior citizens to families with children.

Blue Lacy,"The Blue Lacy, also called the Lacy Dog, is an energetic, intelligent, and trainable breed that loves having a job to do and a lot of open space to run around. Even though the breed has “Blue” in its name, Blue Lacys can also have red or tri-colored coats, though they all carry the blue color gene. The “Lacy” in the breed’s name does not refer to the dog’s appearance at all, but rather comes from the name of the family that first created the breed. The Blue Lacy was developed in the 1800s to help with herding, hunting, and ranch work in Texas. These dogs are hardy, adaptable, and able to learn quickly, though their high intensity and energy level make them ill-suited for apartment life or novice owners. Blue Lacys can make great family dogs and expert watchdogs with firm training, but they are sensitive and don’t respond well to punishment. Socialization should begin early, as Blue Lacys are naturally territorial, not overly trusting of strangers, and have a high prey drive that can cause them to attack smaller animals and pets if they aren’t socialized. With confident, assertive training that relies on positive reinforcement, dogs of this breed can be loyal, protective, and capable members of the family that are eager to please. Experienced owners that are ready to give this dog a task will be rewarded with a lifelong friend that will rise to any challenge.",https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/04/blue-lacy-dog-breed-pictures-header-460x260.jpg,1,1,4,2,4,5,3,4,3,2,2,3,3,2,5,4,2,3,3,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,Working Dogs,53.34,17.01,14.0

These adorable pups do well in apartments and houses with fenced yards, whether it’s with single seniors or households with children.

Boerboel,"At first glance, you might think the large, intimidating Boerboel would make an excellent guard dog, and you’d be correct, but this breed is equally known for being loving, calm, and family-friendly, especially towards human children. These gigantic protectors were bred to help farmers in South Africa defend their homesteads from hyenas, lions, and all manner of deadly wildlife while also providing invaluable companionship. The Boerboel, pronounced “boo-r-bull,” gets its name from Dutch/Afrikaans words that roughly translate to “farmer’s dog.” It is also known as the South African Mastiff, South African Boerboel, Borbull, or Bole. Although Boerboels are generally docile, easy to groom, and have few health problems, don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re an easy breed to handle for first time owners.

Black and Tan Coonhound,"Born in the USA, the outgoing and friendly Black and Tan Coonhound is a versatile companion who shines in the show ring and field. At home, they’re a superb playmate, jogging or walking companion, and bed warmer. Because of their strong hunting instinct and specialized skills, however, this breed rarely thought of as a family dog. Apartment dwellers will find it difficult to provide enough room for exercise, and novice dog parents will struggle with the breed’s intensity. Still, for people who admire the hound’s independent nature and sense of humor, they can make an excellent companion, and at home they tend to be laidback, playful, and gentle. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you.

Bernese Mountain Dog,"The Bernese Mountain Dog is an extremely versatile working dog from the farmlands of Switzerland. They were developed to herd cattle, pull carts, and be watchdogs and loyal companions. They are one of four types of Swiss Mountain Dogs, and the only one with long hair. The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence their name. They’re a large and sturdy dog breed , with a friendly and calm disposition, and they’re also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions. A novice dog owner might be attracted to this breed’s friendly disposition, intelligence, and highly trainable nature. However, first-time dog owners should beware. The Bernese Mountain Dog’s size and high energy can make handling difficult. Thus, they don’t appreciate being cooped up in apartments all day. They shed a lot, and they tend to need the drool wiped from their faces every once in a while. Dogs of this breed are great watchdogs, but that also means they have a tendency to bark–loudly. They may want to chase smaller animals and play roughly, even though they are quite gentle when fully mature and trained properly. Although, for an experienced owner who can match the Bernese’s energy, provide open space, keep up with grooming, and dedicate time and effort to training, this breed will show unconditional love and loyalty. A well-trained Bernese makes an excellent companion that will adore the whole family. They love kids and will even greet newcomers to the home warmly, so long as they’ve had adequate socialization training. There aren’t many breeds with a greater predisposition for friendliness.

Not only are dogs of this breed big; they’re known to be stubborn. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs require firm, consistent trainers with experience handling dogs. Also, while grooming requirements are fairly minimal, owners should have the vacuum on standby. Be ready to clean up all the fur they shed throughout the year. A trained and well-socialized Anatolian Shepherd is a friend and guardian for anyone they consider to be their “flock,” which includes the human members of their family. They are even friendly with their human children, though their size makes it easy for them to knock over a kid during vigorous play. They may also chase other pets or animals if they owners don’t train them properly. Therefore, socialization and behavior training should start early on, ideally in puppyhood.
