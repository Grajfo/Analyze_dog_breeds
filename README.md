# Analyze_dog_breeds_with_AI
Classification of dog breeds according to the group to which they belong.

We obtained the data from the website: https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles, 
We extracted 37 different pieces of information from it, from the description of the breeds to the url images in different specifications such as lifespan, height, weight, adaptability, breed group, etc.

All the input data we used, both numerical data, we decided to use a group of breeds as the output attribute.\nAll these attributes contain different data about dogs, with which it is possible to identify breeds, since some breeds are more oriented towards sports and therefore have a larger rating for energy value, fast, learning, as mixed dogs or companion dogs, which are more focused on being family friendly and obedient, etc...

Breeds are divided into 8 different groups: Mixed breeds, Hybrid breeds, companion dogs dogs, sports dogs, working dogs, terrier dogs, hound dogs, sheepdogs When collecting data, we will change data such as height and weight as the data was given in American measurements (inch, pound)."
